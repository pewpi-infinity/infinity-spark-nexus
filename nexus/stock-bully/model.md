# Reality → Plateau Model

This token responds to **categories**, not prices:

- Weather stability (disruptions slow growth)
- Production throughput (stalled vs expanding)
- Adoption momentum (tools used vs ignored)
- Supply pressure (flooded markets plateau)
- Coordination quality (planning reduces friction)

**If reality worsens:** value plateaus.  
**If reality improves across categories:** value steps up.

No drops. Ever.
